  			<td>The Lamborghini Urus is an SUV manufactured by Italian car manufacturer Lamborghini. It was unveiled on 4 December 2017 and will be put on the market for the 2018 model year. The name comes from the Urus, the ancestor of modern domestic cattle, also known as the aurochs.
Lamborghini has yet to announce pricing for the Urus, but we can assume that it will be around the $200,000 mark. This puts the Urus right within spitting distance of its corporate cousin, the Bentley Bentayga. The Bentayga also has very impressive performance thanks to a 6.0-liter twin-turbo W12. It also holds the record for the fastest SUV in the world. But it won't be long before the Urus takes that away. Even though the Bentayga is an impressive car, its main focus is opulent luxury, not all-out performance. The Bentayga may end up being a bit more expensive than the Urus, but it's clear that Lamborghini wants its SUV to be the best in the world, which is why it will also be one of the priciest.</td>
